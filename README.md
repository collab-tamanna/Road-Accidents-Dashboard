# Road-Accidents-Dashboard
This project involves creating a comprehensive Road Accident Dashboard that visualizes various types of casualty data. It displays total casualties, breaking them down by severity (fatal, serious, slight) and by vehicle type. The dashboard includes trends comparing current and previous years' casualties, casualties by road type, surface conditions, location, and light conditions. A filter panel allows users to refine data by date ranges and location types, providing valuable insights for policymakers and safety officials to make informed decisions based on accurate and comprehensive data.
